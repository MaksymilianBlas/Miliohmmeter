Miliohmmeter project, inspired by video on Learn Electronics Repair channel.
This is an adaptation of a project that has been shown on Learn Electronics Repair channel, link to original video:

I wanted to replace the bulky PCB (that was designed by someone and posted on PCBway projects page) with my own design, with SMD parts and better layout. The project was made in KiCad.
Additionally, a linear power supply has been integrated onto the PCB.
The PCBA with a suitable transformer has been placed in a small project case, with banana sockets and a 5-digit display.
Along the way, there have been some issues caused by counterfit OP07 op-amps from aliexpress.
The weakpoint of the project are the home-made poor-mans kelvin connection probes, because the tip is soldered together and is neither sharp enough or resistant to oxidation enough to guarantee a long problem-free and pleasant usage. The leads were not updated due to high cost and lost interest.
